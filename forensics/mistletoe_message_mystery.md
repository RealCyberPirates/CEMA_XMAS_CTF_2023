# Mistletoe Message Mystery

**Objective**: To locate a lost Christmas card containing magical incantations essential for Santa's sleigh ride.

## Approach and Solution

### Initial Clue from Administrator Elf

The challenge began with data provided by the Administrator elf, a pcap linked at <https://gofile.io/d/5Bx49m>. and 3 files:

- Santa's Archives.log
- Santa's Recipes
- Santa's Workshop

### Analyzing Santa's Archives.log

The file "Santa's Archives.log" was identified as a log file containing SSL/TLS secrets, generated by NSS. This was crucial for decrypting TLS data in the packet capture analysis.

### Decrypting and Extracting DNS Records

Using the SSL/TLS secrets from Santa's Archives.log, the encrypted TLS data in the packet capture (pcap) file was decrypted. This allowed for the extraction and analysis of DNS records.

### Discovering a Suspicious URL

Among various websites visited, a specific URL to an image on Imgur <https://i.imgur.com/4FmsTKE.jpg> was found in packet `18456`. The image appeared to be a Christmas tree ornament.

### Downloading and Analyzing the Image

The image was downloaded using wget:

```bash
wget https://i.imgur.com/4FmsTKE.jpg
```

Common tools were run against the image, but no significant findings were revealed initially.

### Steganographic Analysis with Steghide

Applying steghide to the downloaded image:

```bash
steghide extract -sf 4FmsTKE.jpg
```

This command revealed another image named `flag.jpg`.

### Uncovering the Flag

The `flag.jpg` image contained the hidden flag for the challenge:

`CEMA{Fr057y_Fl4g_F0und}`
