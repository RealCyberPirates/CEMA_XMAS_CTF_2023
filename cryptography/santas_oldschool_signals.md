# Santa's Oldschool Signals" Challenge

Description: This challenge involved decoding a message conveyed through signal flags in an image named "`Santas_Oldschool_Signals.png`".

## Image Analysis

- Downloaded the image "Santas_Oldschool_Signals.png", which displayed a series of signal flags.

## Decoding the Signal Flags

- Upon close inspection, each flag in the image represented a letter.
- The flags were decoded to the following sequence of letters: `GUVF PBAPYHQRF GUR KZNF PGS`.

## Applying ROT13 Deciphering

- Recognizing that the sequence might be encoded using the ROT13 cipher, a simple letter substitution method where each letter is aced by the 13th letter after it in the alphabet, the decoding process was applied.
- The ROT13 translation of `GUVF PBAPYHQRF GUR KZNF PGS` resulted in: `THIS CONCLUDES THE XMAS CTF`.

## Flag

`CEMA{THIS_CONCLUDES_THE_XMAS_CTF}`
